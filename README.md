# Lily's HW1

This my very first game created using Unity. 

I mainly took references from the 'Roll-a-Ball' tutorial made by Unity, the class recordings of Code Lab 0, and my friend Mashi's Unity workshops during the winter break.

The goal of the game is to collect enough amount of treasures by controlling the ball with WASD. There are two levels that the users can choose.
